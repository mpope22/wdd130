            Hello, my name is Matthew Pope, I am from Utah. My family is very important to me, My world revolves around
            them and every decision I make has them in mind. I love to learn and to play sports, I am a big soccer fan
            and grew up playing it my whole life. I love to watch all sports especially football and basketball. I hope
            that as I learn more about web development that I can become a great programmer to provide for my family. I
            am a 24 year old college student who is working as I go to school to ensure that my family always has what
            they need. I love God and by keeping him as the center of my interactions and the center of everything as I
            go to school it allows me to learn quicker, easier, and to be less frustrated when I don't understand
            something right away. I know that through Christ and His atonement I can achieve my dreams. God is aware of
            me and he wants me to succeed and he helps me everyday. I hope that this stepping stone helps me to grow and
            truly become who God wants and needs me to be.
        </p>

            Utah is a beautiful place. When you explore the great wilderness in the outdoors you can truly see God's
            hand in the creation of it all.
